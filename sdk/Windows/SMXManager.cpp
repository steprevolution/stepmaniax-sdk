// Lights are updated with two commands.  The top two rows of LEDs in each panel are

// command.  We need to send the two commands in order.  The panel won't update lights
// until both commands have been received, so we don't flicker the partial top update
// before the bottom update is received.
//
// A complete update can be performed at up to 30 FPS, but we actually update at 60
// FPS, alternating between updating the top and bottom half.
//
// This interlacing is performed to reduce the amount of work the panels and master
// controller need to do on each update.  This improves timing accuracy, since less
// time is taken by each update.
//
// The order of lights is:
//
// 0123 0123 0123
// 4567 4567 4567
// 89AB 89AB 89AB
// CDEF CDEF CDEF
//

// 0123 0123 0123
// 4567 4567 4567
// 89AB 89AB 89AB
// CDEF CDEF CDEF
//
// with panels left-to-right, top-to-bottom.  The first packet sends all 0123 and 4567
// lights, and the second packet sends 78AB and CDEF.
//
// We hide these details from the API to simplify things for the user:
//
// - The user sends us a complete lights set.  This should be sent at (up to) 30Hz.
// If we get lights data too quickly, we'll always complete the one we started before
// sending the next.
// - We don't limit to exactly 30Hz to prevent phase issues where a 60 FPS game is
// coming in and out of phase with our timer.  To avoid this, we limit to 40Hz.
// - When we have new lights data to send, we send the first half right away, wait
// 16ms (60Hz), then send the second half, which is the pacing the device expects.
// - If we get a new lights update in between the two lights commands, we won't split
// the lights.  The two lights commands will always come from the same update, so
// we don't get weird interlacing effects.
// - If SMX_ReenableAutoLights is called between the two commands, we need to guarantee
// that we don't send the second lights commands, since that may re-disable auto lights.
// - If we have two pads, the lights update is for both pads and we'll send both commands
// for both pads at the same time, so both pads update lights simultaneously.
